## Description:
Each folder consists some problems covering different fundamental concepts in Image Processing. <br>
Also, you may want to learn more about the theories by reading this refrence: Digital Image Processing, Rafael C. Gonzalez - Richard E. Woods <br>
### Problem set 1: 
Use imag1.tiff and imag2.tiff files to create following results in MATLAB. <br>

### Problem set 2: 
Change the imag3.tiff light intensity using following transformation and show the result.  <br>

### Problem set 3: Image Quantization
Use the car image <br>
1. Read this image using MATLAB function and store in "color_car" array. Then transfer it to grayscale and show both images. 
2. For grayscale and each RGB channel calculate below measurments: 
   * Maximum and minimum intensity
   * Average of intensity
   * Variance of intensity
3. Try holding each RGB channel at a time and reset the two other channels to zero. Show the results. Which color channels has the most information of the image in this case? Which color will appear black or white and why? 
4. Now invert the value of each color channel(Hint: Maximum intensity - pixel's intensity) and show the results. 
5. Elminate ONLY one color channel by assigning zero to it each time. Eliminating which color channel does the least damage to the image?
6. According to part-2 if we want to use only 4,3,2 bits ( totally 9 bits) to depict different color channels, how would you allocate these bits to each color channel in order to have the least damage to the image's information?
7. Find the components' value for CIE XYZ, RGB image. 
8. Repeat part-6 for this system.
